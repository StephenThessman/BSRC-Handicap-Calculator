# BSRC Handicap Calculator
An app that has digitalised the paper form that BSRC uses to determine a shooter's handicap. The handicap is determined by the shooter's score and average from the previous series in the competition. Before we use to have to line up the score and average on a sheet of A4 paper which could lead to incorrect scoring.

This app works by entering the score in the right-hand box and the average in the left-hand box. Then by pressing the calculate button it checks a data sheet asset and determines the handicap. If out of range the app will inform the individual of the issue at hand. The app does not allow for decimal placing in the input boxes.
